# CET Formula

## Overview
The CET Formula proposes a universal behavioral orbit equation:

**S(t) = C(t) × E(t) × T**  
**dS/dt = C(t) × E(t) − λS(t)**

Where:
- **C(t)** = Cognition at time t
- **E(t)** = Execution at time t
- **T** = Time horizon maintained
- **λ** = Structural degradation coefficient

## Structural Attribution Submission
This repository includes a formal submission to the Arweave ecosystem to permanently seal the origin and structural attribution of the CET Formula.

- [CET Structure Seal Letter to Arweave (PDF)](./CET%20Structure%20Seal%20Letter%20to%20Arweave.pdf)

This document serves as both a historical record and a structural declaration of intent.

## What is CET?
CET (Cognition × Execution × Time) is a structural equation designed to model and predict goal-aligned behavior over time. It frames behavioral evolution as a trajectory system:

- **Cognition (C):** Reasoning capacity, schema complexity, working memory  
- **Execution (E):** Ability to persist, act, and convert intent into output  
- **Time (T):** Both a developmental amplifier and a constraint

The resulting function:
**S(t) = C(t) × E(t) × T**

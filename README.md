# CET Formula – Cognition × Execution × Time

**Discoverer:** Hanfoong Soo (March 2025)  
**Formula:** `S(t) = C(t) × E(t) × T`

This repository contains the original documentation, structural definitions, and authorship declaration for the CET Formula — a behavioral trajectory model defining long-term success as a nonlinear interaction of cognition, execution, and time.

## What is CET?

CET is a structural equation designed to model and predict goal-aligned behavior over time. It frames behavioral evolution as a trajectory system:

- **Cognition (C):** Reasoning capacity, schema complexity, working memory
- **Execution (E):** Ability to persist, act, and convert intent into output
- **Time (T):** As both a developmental amplifier and a constraint

The resulting function:  
**`S(t) = C(t) × E(t) × T`**
